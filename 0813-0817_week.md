## Part 1. Reproduce HLW (Horizon lines in the wild) paper

[http://gitlab.hobot.cc/dongxu.miao/deephorizon_reproduce/](http://gitlab.hobot.cc/dongxu.miao/deephorizon_reproduce/)

* [scottworkman/deephorizon](https://github.com/scottworkman/deephorizon)
    - Only inference, and Caffe
* Multi-output network on pre-trained model (multi tasks?)
* Data generator for large dataset
    - set up train/val/test files
* Preprocessing
    - data augmentation
    - slope/offset will change when the image is cropped/flipped/rotated

## Part 2. Labeling Vanishing Point (and horizon line)

It takes about 7.5s to label one image (200 images, 25 minutes).

There are some images we should discuss.
