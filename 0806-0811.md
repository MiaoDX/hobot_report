# 0809

DONE:

* Multi VP and Horizon Lines

TODO:

* Post processing (python)
* HLW



# 0808

DONE:

* One workable VP/horizon line labeling tool, [http://gitlab.hobot.cc/dongxu.miao/VP_horizon_line_labeling_matlab](http://gitlab.hobot.cc/dongxu.miao/VP_horizon_line_labeling_matlab)

TODO:

* Post processing (python)
* HLW


# 0807

DONE:

* Try to use [pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph](https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph) to do the GUI, maybe okay, but stopped for matlab one
* Matlab one
    - Not done, some tricky bug

TODO:

* VP label tool
* Make sure the HLW dataset is downloaded

# 0806

DONE:

* Prepare for the vanishing point/horizon line labeling tool
    - Use bare OpenCV maybe enough for the minimal requirements, but there is no support even for browsing the directory
* Second round of job interview with yinan.yu
    - Kinda of failed the interview, it hurts a little (or a lot?), really.

TODO:

* VP tool
* Run the HLW(Horizon lines in the Wild) experiment
