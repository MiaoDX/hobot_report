DONE:
* set up train/val/test files
* preprocess the images (center crop, resize, to keras format)
* data generator

TODO:
* make the network run
* label some Vanishing Points in images

# 0815

DONE:
* Set up the network with two output layer
* parameterize the horizon line with slope and offset
* make one data generator for (X, Y1, Y2) format

TODO:
* put the data generator and the network together


# 0814

Digest the possibility to use keras to implement the multi output label transfer learning with existing networks (VGG16 or InceptionV3).

There are some nice tutorials online, and there are two big challenge:
* prepare the dataset
* add multi output onto the top of model

TODO:
Try to make a workable network.


# 0813

Today tried to understand how to load data with multi label into Caffe, it is not so straightforward, sine the LMDB is only `DATA+LABEL`. And maybe it is better to write one `datalayer`, then no extra disk is needed for the image data in LMDB files?(Right?)

Or, should I convert the network to pytorch one?

TODO:

* Try to write on datalayer
