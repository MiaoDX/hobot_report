Today tried to understand how to load data with multi label into Caffe, it is not so straightforward, sine the LMDB is only `DATA+LABEL`. And maybe it is better to write one `datalayer`, then no extra disk is needed for the image data in LMDB files?(Right?)

Or, should I convert the network to pytorch one?
