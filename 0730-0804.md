# 0730

DONE:

* Read paper, Detecting Vanishing Points using Global Image Context in a Non-Manhattan World
    - This is one of the state-of-the art for VP detection (However, the output seems to be the horizon line instead of VP)
* Try to build VPGNet
    - It seems that the code is now completed, [the author update VP part of the algorithm](https://github.com/SeokjuLee/VPGNet/issues/24)
    - NOT finished (building)

TODO:

* Run the code of VPGNet on Caltech Lane dataset
* See paper [Horizon Lines in the Wild](https://github.com/scottworkman/deephorizon)
