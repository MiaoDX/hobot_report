## Setup Caffe on server

* Anaconda way, see [https://github.com/MiaoDX/system_configuration/blob/master/install_caffe.md](https://github.com/MiaoDX/system_configuration/blob/master/install_caffe.md)
* Still failed on python3.x (seems to be the caffe version of VPGNet)

## Reproduce VPGNet

* Run on Caltech lane

## TODO:

* VP and horizon line label tool
* Run the snapshot (trained model) on test data and visualize the result (may need code for lane clustering and segmentation)
